            <h1>Houseplant Guide</h1>
            <p>All the houseplants on our list are easy to care for and largely fool-proof. Even so, some can be trickier than others. For this reason, we have divided the list into two categories: easy and very easy. Whether a plant is “easy-care” or not comes down to what conditions the plant can tolerate and how much attention it needs: Does it thrive in both bright and dim lighting? Can it tolerate being overwatered one week and underwatered the next? Is it sensitive to tap water, low humidity, or other factors that come with being indoors? Does it need special care during the winter?</p>

            <p>These plants are pretty much bulletproof. They are easy to find in stores (and thus, easy to replace if worst comes to worst) and do not require much more than a basic level of care. They also have the ability to bounce back from common problems such as over- or underwatering, improper lighting, and fluctuating temperatures. Spider plant; Thanks to its hardy and prolific nature, the spider plant is a long-standing staple among houseplant-lovers. They thrive in bright, indirect light, but will grow happily in a dimmer location, too. After a while, spider plants will produce a chain of white flowers and “pups”—baby plants that hang down from the mother plant and add another element of interest. Lucky bamboo;Ever seen those bundles of living “bamboo” for sale at the local supermarket? That is lucky bamboo—a popular houseplant that is said to bring good fortune. In truth, this plant is not a type of bamboo at all, but has a similar look to the real thing and is nearly as difficult to kill. </p>

            <h2>common houseplant diseases</h2>
            <p>Pests can be a real problem. They usually appear after outdoor plants are brought inside for the winter, or when a new houseplant is brought home. To get rid of bugs in houseplants, push a clove of garlic into the plants soil. If the garlic sprouts and grows, just cut it back. Spider mites are apt to thrive in warm, dry houses. Frequent misting under the leaves of houseplants will discourage them. A solution of 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup buttermilk, and a gallon of cool water, applied in a mist, is a good organic deterrent.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Water plants with room-temperature water. Cold water can be a shock to a houseplants roots—like sticking your toes into an ice bath! Use filtered water if your tap water contains high amounts of minerals or chemicals. Fluoride can cause the leaf tips of some houseplants, such as peace lilies, to turn brown. Always water until the excess water drains out of the holes. Even plants that prefer dry soil should be watered this way (just not as frequently). Water gently over the top of the soil; avoid water on the plant leaves or crown. A long-spouted watering can works best.</p>
