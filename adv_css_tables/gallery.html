            <h2>common houseplant diseases</h2>
            <p>Pests can be a real problem. They usually appear after outdoor plants are brought inside for the winter, or when a new houseplant is brought home. To get rid of bugs in houseplants, push a clove of garlic into the plants soil. If the garlic sprouts and grows, just cut it back. Spider mites are apt to thrive in warm, dry houses. Frequent misting under the leaves of houseplants will discourage them. A solution of 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup buttermilk, and a gallon of cool water, applied in a mist, is a good organic deterrent.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Water plants with room-temperature water. Cold water can be a shock to a houseplants rootsâ€”like sticking your toes into an ice bath! Use filtered water if your tap water contains high amounts of minerals or chemicals. Fluoride can cause the leaf tips of some houseplants, such as peace lilies, to turn brown. Always water until the excess water drains out of the holes. Even plants that prefer dry soil should be watered this way (just not as frequently). Water gently over the top of the soil; avoid water on the plant leaves or crown. A long-spouted watering can works best.</p>
