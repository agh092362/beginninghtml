        <h2>Growing Lettuce And Tomatoes</h2>
        <p>Lettuce is pretty easy to grow. Choose a planting location that is cool and shady. Make sure the soil drains well. Remove any weeds, rocks and sticks from the soil. Plant seeds or plants about 1/4 inch deep in rows 1 inch apart. Water regulary, keeping soil evenly moist. Harvest the lettuce when the leaves are big enough to eat.</p>

        <p> Tomatoes need plenty of sun to grow. They need 6-8 hours of sun daily. Tomatoes grow better in moist, well-drained soil. Plant seeds or seedlings in warm soil after the last frost The hole should be deep enough to cover roots and a few inches of the seedling stem. Water regularly and plan to stake them as they grow. The fruit needs to stay off of the ground, you can use cages or plant stakes. Harvest when they have a deep rich color.</p>
