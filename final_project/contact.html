            <h2>Hat Care Guide</h2>
            <p>Dust your hat with a soft bristled brush to keep it clean. Heat will shrink the interior sweatband - avoid exposure to stoves, radiators, lamps and car windows. Store your hat in a cool dry place to help it to retain its shape and stay clean. Out-of-season, store your hat in a hat box. When putting your hat down on a flat surface, lay it upside down on its crown, not on its brim. Leaving it on its brim will cause it to flatten out and change shape. Beware of moths making a snack of your topper â€” use lavender or cedar, to keep these buggers at bay.</p>
