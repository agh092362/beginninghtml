            <h1>Hat Personality</h1>
            
            <p>The hat can represent authority and power. Because it covers the head, the hat contains thought; therefore, if it is changed, an opinion is changed. The covered head may show nobility, and different hats signify different orders within the social heirarchy. Removal of a hat, usually by men, upon entry into a building shows respect. Hats help you draw attention and make you stand out from the crowd. Wearing a hat will complete your look - it's a simple yet great accessory to make you look confident. Whether you prefer to wear it as a sporty accessory or a fashion statement, the hat will make you hold your head up high.</p>

            <p>We all know a Hat Girl. Someone beautiful and effortless, with the face and attitude and personal style required to pull off that most elusive of accessories: the hat. Sometimes you hate them, sometimes you love them, sometimes you just want to be them. Anyone can wear a hat. You only need to become familiar with your face shape and what hat shape suits you. Whether it's a Panama hat in the summer, a fedora hat in the winter, or maybe just a flat cap, it may make you look more mature.</p>

            <h3>Why Wear A Hat?</h3>
            <p>They are comfortable. They are a poor man's sunglasses if you need them. On a windy, rainy or snowy day, they can provide some protection from that. They are bald or balding or otherwise don't have enough hair to prevent their scalps from getting sunburned.The sensation of feeling something snug around one's head might be comforting and reduce anxiety.</p>

            <h3>Hat Care Guide</h3>
            <p>Dust your hat with a soft bristled brush to keep it clean. Heat will shrink the interior sweatband - avoid exposure to stoves, radiators, lamps and car windows. Store your hat in a cool dry place to help it to retain its shape and stay clean. Out-of-season, store your hat in a hat box. When putting your hat down on a flat surface, lay it upside down on its crown, not on its brim. Leaving it on its brim will cause it to flatten out and change shape. Beware of moths making a snack of your topper â€” use lavender or cedar, to keep these buggers at bay.</p>
