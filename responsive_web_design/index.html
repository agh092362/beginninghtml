            <p>Keep your houseplants happy and healthy! From knowing how often to water to providing the correct amount of light, here are tips to ensure that your indoor plants not only stay alive, but thrive. Before you buy a houseplant, make sure your house can provide the amount of light that plant needs. For example, if you buy a cacti, you will need a window that provides bright light (or a supplemental light). When you first bring a plant home, it is normal for the plant to drop a few leaves as it gets used to its new space. If the lighting is to its liking, it will soon adjust. When you first bring a plant home, it is normal for the plant to drop a few leaves as it gets used to its new space. If the lighting is to its liking, it will soon adjust. On the other hand, if the edges of a plants leaves scorch, or the leaves bleach out or appear dull, then the light may be too bright.</p>

            <p>Believe it or not, more houseplants die from overwatering than from anything else! Most houseplants can not tolerate soil that is always wet. Some succulent plants (such as cacti or jade) can survive a month or two without watering. Learn the preferences of your plants. The first step, of course, is to ensure the bottom of your pot has drainage holes. Otherwise, you will need to repot the plant into a pot that does provide sufficient drainage. If a plant sits in wet soil for too long, it can develop root rot and die!</p>

            <p>Pests can be a real problem. They usually appear after outdoor plants are brought inside for the winter, or when a new houseplant is brought home. To get rid of bugs in houseplants, push a clove of garlic into the plants soil. If the garlic sprouts and grows, just cut it back. Spider mites are apt to thrive in warm, dry houses. Frequent misting under the leaves of houseplants will discourage them. A solution of 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup buttermilk, and a gallon of cool water, applied in a mist, is a good organic deterrent.</p>

            <h3>Houseplant Care Guide</h3>
            <p>Water plants with room-temperature water. Cold water can be a shock to a houseplants rootsâ€”like sticking your toes into an ice bath! Use filtered water if your tap water contains high amounts of minerals or chemicals. Fluoride can cause the leaf tips of some houseplants, such as peace lilies, to turn brown. Always water until the excess water drains out of the holes. Even plants that prefer dry soil should be watered this way (just not as frequently). Water gently over the top of the soil; avoid water on the plant leaves or crown. A long-spouted watering can works best. </p>
